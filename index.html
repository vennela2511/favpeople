At ISRO, he played a pivotal role in developing India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-3), which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in 1980, marking a major milestone in India’s space program. His leadership in missile technology, particularly with the Agni and Prithvi missiles, earned him the title “Missile Man of India”.

            <h1 style="color: white;">Mother Teresa</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; color: white;">Mother Teresa, born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu on August 26, 1910, in Skopje (now North Macedonia), was a Roman Catholic nun and missionary renowned for her lifelong dedication to the poor and sick. Coming from an Albanian Catholic family, she was deeply influenced by her mother's compassion and commitment to charity. At 18, she left home to join the Sisters of Loreto in Ireland and soon moved to India, where she began teaching in Kolkata.In 1948, moved by the extreme poverty and suffering she witnessed, Mother Teresa started working directly with the destitute in Kolkata's slums. In 1950, she founded the Missionaries of Charity, a religious congregation focused on caring for "the poorest of the poor," including the sick, orphaned, and dying. Her work earned her international recognition, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 and India's highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna, in 1980.

Mother Teresa's life exemplified selfless service, humility, and compassion. She walked barefoot to reach those in need and spent hours in prayer, drawing strength from her faith. She passed away in 1997 in Kolkata and was canonized as Saint Teresa of Calcutta in 2016. Her legacy continues to inspire millions worldwide to serve humanity with love and kindness.</p>
